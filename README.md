# Data-Masking
Code artefacts for Data masking/ Obfuscation

As part of this project developed reusable code to mask existing big data and generate synthetic data at Scale using PySpark (Fabric / Databricks)

Notebooks here are developed on Microsoft fabric - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric?msockid=243318f36141605817eb09166541669f. If you are running it on different flatform make approproate changes to paths / location of the data.
